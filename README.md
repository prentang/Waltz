#In 1787, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart created a dice game (Mozart’s Musikalisches W¨urfelspiel), in which you compose
#a two-part waltz by pasting together 32 of 272 pre-composed musical elements at random. The goal of this project is to
#implement Mozart’s game by writing a program to generate a two-part waltz and another program to play the waltz.
